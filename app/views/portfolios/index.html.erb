<h1>Portfolio Items</h1>

<%= link_to "Create new Portfolio", new_portfolio_path %>

<!-- will look for a partial _portfolio_item.html.erb (singular) and it will iterate @portfolio_items object based on the partial model-->
<%= render partial: 'portfolio_item', collection: @portfolio_items %>
<!-- in order for this to work it is needed for the controller name, model name and object name to be the same. In this case
there is portfolios_controller.rb, portfolio.rb as model and the index object is @portfolio_items. -->
<!-- To fix it the partial is declared in the render tag and collection is telling rails that the object @portfolio_items is a collection type -->
